# Library System

## Introduction

This repository was created as a university project. It is a conceptual library management system designed to help libraries organize their collections and manage book loans effectively.

The code includes comments in Portuguese to provide clarity within the educational context, as the university course is conducted in this language.

For educational purposes, the use of external libraries was avoided to ensure a deeper understanding of working with vanilla Python. However, the `json`, `uuid` and `datetime` libraries were used since they do not significantly impact the core functionalities of the code like other libraries might.

## Disclaimer
