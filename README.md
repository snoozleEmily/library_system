# Library System

## Introduction

This repository was created as a university project. It is a conceptual library management system designed to help libraries organize their collections and manage book loans effectively.

The code includes comments in Portuguese to provide clarity within the educational context, as the university course is conducted in this language.

For educational purposes, the system was initially developed without using the pandas library to ensure a deeper understanding of working with vanilla Python. It was then refactored to incorporate it.
